# ReactChat

ReactChat is a robust and efficient real-time chat application designed with React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. Utilizing Socket.IO for communication and Redux for state management, ReactChat offers a smooth and responsive user experience for messaging.

## Features

- **Real-time Messaging**: Instant message sending and receiving using Socket.IO.
- **Message Timestamps**: Each message is timestamped to show when it was sent.
- **State Management**: Efficient state management with Redux.
- **User-friendly UI**: Clean and intuitive user interface designed with React.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile screens.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The primary framework for building the user interface.
- **Redux**: For managing the application state.
- **Socket.IO**: For real-time communication between the client and server.
- **Node.js**: For the backend server implementation.
- **Express**: For setting up the server and handling API requests.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.

## Core Logic

### Socket Manager

- **Socket Connection**: Manages the connection to the Socket.IO server.
- **Event Handling**: Listens for incoming messages and broadcasts outgoing messages.
- **Message Handling**: Adds timestamps to messages and emits responses.

### State Management

- **Redux Store**: Manages the application state, including messages and user input.
- **Actions**: Defines actions for adding messages to the store.
- **Reducers**: Updates the state based on actions dispatched.

## Project Structure

### Backend

- `server.js`: Sets up the Express server and Socket.IO.
- `package.json`: Lists the dependencies for the backend.

### Frontend

- `App.js`: The main React component containing the chat interface.
- `actions.js`: Defines Redux actions for managing messages.
- `reducers.js`: Contains Redux reducers to handle state changes.
- `store.js`: Sets up the Redux store.

### Styles

- `App.css`: Contains the CSS styles for the application.
